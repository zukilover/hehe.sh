Hey there! I've been tinkering with front-end development for quite a while now. I started out in 2010, offering a simple PSD to HTML service. Over time, that grew into a broader front-end development venture, exploring everything from the jQuery days to the ever-evolving world of Angular and React.

Around 2015, I dive into an offline contract as a React/React Native consultant. That journey led me into working on applications related to the banking sector. And now, I'm back and feeling pretty stoked about it!

My journey into programming started back in high school, where I landed my first gig as a Joomla developer. Since then, I've been exploring the realm of e-commerce development, dabbling in platforms like Magento, Shopify, and Volusion. The adventure continues, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next!
